# Security Check-up

***A platform to help you create strong passwords , easy to remember and unique in nature.***

## Welcome!

First and foremost, Welcome! :tada:

Thank you for visiting the Security Check-up project repository.    

We are working with students,developers and community members to build a platform for the awareness of secure password so that the NETIZENS are secure from Cyber attacks happening due to weak passwords and making internet users aware about privacy and security.

### The Problem
Today we lack strong password, even if we have using a tool, that is very difficult to remember. Password storing services are also not secure for storing your important passwords.

### The Solution
This platform will help internet users to create strong password which will be easy to remember and unique in nature for their different sites/network .

### What makes this unique ?
This platform will help individuals learning the new technique of creating a strong password , which will be unique for different platforms and easy to remember at the same time. We offer a subscription service free of cost to remind the user to change their password using the same technique at a regular interval as set by the user during signup.

## What do we need?

**You**! In whatever way you can help.

We need expertise in fundraising, web development, user experience design, git, database maintenance (particularly ensuring the highest quality data protection plans are in place), documentation and technical writing and project management.

We'd love your feedback along the way, and of course, we'd love you to be **in the database** once it exists.

Our primary goal is to educate the internet user to adpot this culture of creating a strong password and create awareness about user's basic privacy rights. If you're looking to learn to code, try out working collaboratively, get some experience writing grant applications or translate you skills to the digital domain, we're here to help.
